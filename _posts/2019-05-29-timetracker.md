<p>This simple JavaScript widget lets the user track how she spends her time. Clicking on an activity starts or adds to a timer, while pausing all other timers. New custom timers can be added at the bottom of the widget. Each new timer is given one of four random colors.</p>
<p>Click "view live project" to try it out or click "view code" to see how it works.</p>
