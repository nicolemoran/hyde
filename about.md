title: About Me
---

<p>Hi there! My name is Nicole and this is my web design and development portfolio. I am a graduate of James Madison University, where I majored in Media Arts and Design, with a concentration in Interactive Design and a minor in Educational Media. All of those fancy words just mean that <b>I love creating digital solutions.</b> Whether it's a little custom CSS in WordPress or a full-blown web application, I am always eager to solve problems with code. Check out the home page of this website to see some of my work.</p>

<p>My priorities on every project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Priority #1 is <b>functionality</b>. Check every box, on time.</li>
  <li>Priority #2 is <b>user-friendliness</b>. Because "figuring out the site" should not be a thing.</li>
  <li>Priority #3 is <b>visual aesthetics</b>. Because people do judge books by their covers.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few facts about me and how I work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm a big-picture thinker.</li>
  <li>I like things clean and minimal, both in code and in life.</li>
  <li>I relish a good challenge, and pick up new skills quickly.</li>
</ul>
